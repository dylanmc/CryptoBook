# Getting started

This book is a guide to learning about cryptography, the math that cryptography is built on,
and how to write programs that implement cryptographic algorithms. Don't worry if any of that
sounds too complicated: it's all explained inside. Also don't worry if it sounds too boring:
these topics are surprisingly deep and interesting -- there's a lot of cool stuff even jaded
students (of all ages!) can learn.

At the beginning of each chapter, we'll describe what you'll know by the end of the chapter.
If you feel like you already know that stuff, try skimming the chapter (don't skip it!)
to make sure that you do, and slow down and read the new stuff.

At the end of this chapter you'll know what resources you'll need to complete the activities
in the book, and you'll have encrypted and decrypted a message using the Caesar cipher.
Let's get going!

## What you'll need

You'll need a sense of curiosity. You'll also need a dedication to actually doing the exercises:
if you just read this material you'll only get a small fraction of the benefit of doing.
You'll need access to a computer. It can be a Windows, MacOS or Linux computer - they're all
fine.

Having a group of people to work with is a good idea. A lot of the activities require serious thought,
and it's totally normal to get stuck (often). If you work with a group of people, when one of
you gets stuck, the others can help out. Not by giving answers, but by nudging in productive directions.
Often all it takes to do this is to ask "What are you working on? What have you tried? Is there anything
you haven't tried yet?" Explaining the answers to these questions to another person is often
enough to get unstuck.

## Why cryptography?

Cryptography is the mathematics of secret messages. The popularity and pervasiveness of social
media has caused some people to comment "nothing is secret." But is that really true?
People share photos taken in restaurants all the time, but is it a good idea to share a photo
of the credit card you used to pay for your food? What about sharing your social media passwords?

Secret: letter-pair settings

Decode some joke punchlines

Motivate doing these in a computer:

 * hard to encrypt / decrypt lots of text - tedious and error-prone
 * codebreaking / password recovery - even more tedious by hand
