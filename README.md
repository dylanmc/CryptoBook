# Goals of this book

Shooting for high-school-ish aged students, who want to learn about cryptography,
and willing to learn about math and programming along the way.

## Beginnings of an Outline

 * Introduction
    * what to expect, what we expect of you
    * encrypting punchlines with Reverse-Caesar codewheels
 * Encoding information - Binary, ASCII, UTF-8, Morse code, Huffman encoding
    * each chapter begins with "what you'll get out of this chapter", which can also be "if you know all this, you can skim this chapter"
 * Classic encryption algorithms
    * using shared secret keys to communicate in code
    * additive ciphers - revisiting Caesar [modulo arithmetic]
    * multiplicitave ciphers [abstract algebra - operations and inverses]
    * affine ciphers

## Tools used to build the book

I'm planning to write the book in Markdown, and convert to PDF and HTML via Pandoc.
