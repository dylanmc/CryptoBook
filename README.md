# Goals of this book

Shooting for high-school-ish aged students who want to learn about cryptography,
and are willing to learn about math and programming along the way.

## Beginnings of an Outline

 * Introduction
    * what to expect, what we expect of you
    * encrypting punchlines with Reverse-Caesar codewheels
 * Encoding information - Binary, ASCII, UTF-8, Morse code, Huffman encoding
    * each chapter begins with "what you'll get out of this chapter", which can also be "if you know all this, you can skim this chapter"
 * Introduction to Cryptol
    * data types
    * sequences, comprehensions
    * functions
 * Implementing the Caesar Cipher in Cryptol
 * The Enigma
    * a bit of history
    * building one with paper
    * implementing the Enigma in Cryptol

## Tools used to build the book

I'm writing the book in ReStructuredText, and converting to PDF and HTML via Sphinx.
(I switched from Pandoc/Markdown to make it easier to generate the index, and other improvements)
